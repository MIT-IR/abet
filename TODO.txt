---Functionality-----

Outcomes
	-Create SLOs (Student Learning Outcomes, currently defaults to ABET a-k)
	-Map non-ABET SLOs to ABET a-k (look at ABET reports for example, perhaps
	use the "High" "Medium" and "Low" correspondance values)

Contacts
	-Roles management
	-Authentication (Shibboleth/certificates, borrow from eFPR)

Reporting
	-Create report for ABET self-studies (modeled roughly off of EECS report)
	-Think of other types of reports (school level, for example)

Indirect measures
	-Allow for import of survey data (connect to survey database!?)
	-View indirect measures
	-Add own indirect measures
