<h1>Recording Data</h1>

<p>The faculty were surveyed and asked to map the outcomes to their respective undergraduate
classes. They were then asked which assessments would be used to measure those outcomes. For your
subject, you will see each assessment listed. Each assessment will be used to measure how many
students meet the outcomes selected by the faculty.</p>

<h4>Updating the Assessment</h4>

<p>Before you record data, you should confirm both the minimum grade and the target percentage with
the professor. For the purposes of setting up the system, a percentage of 80 was entered. However,
as shown in the example above, the professor might feel a different number is appropriate.</p>

<p>If the minimum grade or target percentage for the assessment are incorrect:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Click the course that the assessment belongs to</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>"Edit"</strong> action for the assessment</li>
</ul>
