        unaligned_outcomes_html: |
          <p>No alignment is required for any particular custom outcome, but in
          the final set of custom outcomes, each ABET outcome should be aligned
          with at least one of the custom outcomes. The outcomes for these
          courses do not align with all of the ABET outcomes.</p>
        without_outcomes_html: |
          <p><em>Adopt Default Outcomes:</em> ABET establishes a set of default
          outcomes that must be assessed.  Each program can choose to adopt
          these default outcomes as their own.  Once you click the "Adopt
          Default Outcomes" link, you will be shown a list of the ABET default
          outcomes and given the opportunity to confirm that you want to adopt
          the default outcomes as the student outcomes for your program.</p>

          <p><em>Create Custom Outcomes:</em> If your department has
          established their own student outcomes, then you can enter these
          custom outcomes by following the link to "Create Custom Outcomes."
          You will then be taken to a form to enter your first custom
          outcome.</p>
