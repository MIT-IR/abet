            <p>Congratulations! These courses have outcomes that fully align with
            ABET outcomes. You are ready to create assessments.</p>
          unaligned_outcomes_html: |
            <p>No alignment is required for any particular custom outcome, but in
            the final set of custom outcomes, each ABET outcome should be aligned
            with at least one of the custom outcomes. The outcomes for these
            courses do not align with all of the ABET outcomes.</p>
          without_outcomes_html: |
            <p><em>Adopt Default Outcomes:</em> ABET establishes a set of default
            outcomes that must be assessed.  Each program can choose to adopt
            these default outcomes as their own.  Once you click the "Adopt
            Default Outcomes" link, you will be shown a list of the ABET default
            outcomes and given the opportunity to confirm that you want to adopt
            the default outcomes as the student outcomes for your program.</p>

            <p><em>Create Custom Outcomes:</em> If your department has
            established their own student outcomes, then you can enter these
            custom outcomes by following the link to "Create Custom Outcomes."
            You will then be taken to a form to enter your first custom
            outcome.</p>
